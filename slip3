Q2 A)Write a Python program to create box plots to see how each feature
i.e. Sepal Length,Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width are distributed
across the three species. (Use iris.csv dataset) 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\dataset\iris.csv')
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="SepalLengthCm", data=iris)
plt.title("Sepal Length by Species")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="SepalWidthCm", data=iris)
plt.title("Sepal Width by Species")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris)
plt.title("Petal Length by Species")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="PetalWidthCm", data=iris)
plt.title("Petal Width by Species")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


B) Write a Python program to view basic statistical details of
 the data (Use Heights and Weights Dataset) 

 import pandas as pd
 df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\dataset\HeightWeight.csv')
 print("Statistical Detail:")
 print(df.describe())
